				<h4>What can this do?</h4>
				<p class="welcome-text">This application will allow you to create a collection of your favourite stocks, check their prices and share them with random people on the <span title="World Wide Web">🌐</span>. You can also check out what stocks those strangers are following. 🔎</p>

Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/eportet/stock-tracker">code</a> and tell me all of the things that I did wrong. 🙂 Thank you for checking this out!</p>
